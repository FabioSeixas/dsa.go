### Binary Tree

- [x] build binary tree from a list (BSF ordered)
- [x] get items list (BSF ordered) from a binary tree
- [x] Find an item on a BinaryTree (nil if does not exist)
- [ ] Find the level of an item on a BinaryTree (nil if does not exist)
- [ ] build binary tree from a list (DSF ordered)
- [ ] get items list (DSF ordered) from a binary tree
- [ ] add new item to an existing Binary Tree (rebalance if needed)
- [ ] remove an item from an existing Binary Tree (rebalance if needed)
